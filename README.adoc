* This is a desktop TouristBook application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for tourists coming to Singapore for sightseeing.
* It provides a comprehensive list of the popular attractions in Singapore, as well as some *useful features* like a MRT map and a list of useful numbers.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[level 4]:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list  panel and an in-built Browser.
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
