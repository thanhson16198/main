=== Enhancement Added: Displaying of Useful Contacts

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=usefulContacts]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since the project is targeted at tourists who are visiting Singapore, it is important for them to
have easy access to a list of emergency numbers in Singapore for easy reference should the need arises. The list
of numbers include hospitals and ambulance hotlines.

=== Enhancement Added: Find Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since the project is implemented with Places and using tags to describe a place (e.g. onestar), it is required for
users to be able to search the list either by name or by the tag that the place is tagged to for easy reference.
In addition, users may want to search for more than one name or tag at the same time as well.

==== Implementation

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Backup Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

This is to allow users to be able to backup their data. In the event their main file is corrupted or lost, there is
still a backup file.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=backup]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Export Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=export]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

As described in the User Stories, this is to allow users to be able to save and print out their files easily so that
they are still able to know the information about a place without being connected to a computer.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=exportCommand]

#End of Extract#
